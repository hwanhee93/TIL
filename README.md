# TIL

> Today I Learned

A collection of concise write-ups on small things I learn day to day across a
variety of languages and technologies. These are things that don't really
warrant a full blog post. These are mostly things I learn by pairing with
smart people at [Hashrocket](http://hashrocket.com/).

For a steady stream of TILs from a variety of rocketeers, checkout
